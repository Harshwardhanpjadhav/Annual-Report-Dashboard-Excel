## Overview
This dashboard provides an annual overview of store performance, highlighting key metrics such as total orders, sales trends, customer demographics, and sales channels. The goal is to give a clear, interactive snapshot of business performance and help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Features
1. **Orders vs. Sales Chart (Top-Left)**
   - A bar and line combination chart showing total orders (bars) versus total sales (line) over a specific time period or product categories.
   - Helps visualize trends in orders placed and revenue generated.

2. **Sales by Gender (Top-Center)**
   - A pie chart illustrating the proportion of sales made by men vs. women.
   - Quickly identifies which gender segment contributes most to sales.

3. **Order Status (Top-Right)**
   - A pie chart displaying the breakdown of orders by status (e.g., completed, pending, returned).
   - Provides insight into the overall health of the order fulfillment process.

4. **Orders by Age Group (Bottom-Center)**
   - A bar chart categorizing orders based on customer age ranges (e.g., teenagers, adults, seniors).
   - Useful for targeting marketing efforts and understanding which age groups are most active.

5. **Order Channels (Bottom-Right)**
   - A pie chart showing the distribution of orders across different sales channels (e.g., online, in-store, phone).
   - Highlights the most popular channels and where to allocate resources.

6. **Slicers (Right-Side)**
   - Interactive filters that allow you to slice data by **Category**, **Region**, **Manager**, or other fields.
   - Selecting or deselecting items in the slicers will update all charts simultaneously, enabling quick, customized views of the data.

   - Click on any slicer to filter the dashboard.  
   - Multiple selections are possible by holding **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Cmd** (Mac) while clicking.

4. **Analyze the Charts**  
   - Hover over each segment of the pie/bar charts to see exact figures or percentages.
   - Identify trends and outliers in your orders, sales, and demographic breakdowns.

5. **Reset Filters**
